[SolidusDigitalAssets](https://github.com/vinsol/solidus_digital_assets)
==================

Solidus Port of [SpreeDigitalAssets](https://github.com/vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_digital_assets).

This gem allows you to have a central repository of your store's assets. The assets can be uploaded
in advance and can be associated with the products/variants at the time of product/variant
creation.

This will also act as a central repository that can be used to access all the assets of the system
and can then be used in different products.

## Features

* Has default folders “Documents”, “Photos” and “Graphics”

* Assets can be uploaded to each folder by using the upload feature

* Ability to view assets in List view

* Excellent UI

* Ability to remove / edit / download each asset

* Associate assets while creating product / variant
